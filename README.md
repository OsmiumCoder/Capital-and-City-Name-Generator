# Capital-and-City-Name-Generator
A weekend project for a Fantasy Name Generator.

## Description
The Capital and City Name Generator was designed as a short project to solve the issue of uninteresting name generators
that currently exist. Some names generated by this project may make no sense, however, these names make for interesting
inspiration.

The project also consists entirely of python. The main focus of the program focused on learning the pygame module. The 
generator is rather simple by choosing random consonants and vowels to construct a prefix then choosing suffix from a
list of suffixes. The main script utilizes the generator to generate and output 15 names to the pygame screen.

## Installation
In order to properly run this program Python will need to be installed. You can download Python for free from their
official website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

After Python has been downloaded click the green code button in the GitHub Repository and **Download Zip**.

Once the zip file has been downloaded extract all to the destination of your choice.

In the extracted folder will be a shortcut which you can drag to your desktop. If you would like to change the shortcut
icon see [SHORTCUT INSTRUCTIONS](Documentation/SHORTCUT%20INSTRUCTIONS.md) under the Documentation folder.



## Usage
Once you have the application open and running click the red button to generate a list of 15 names in the display box.
